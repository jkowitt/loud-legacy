- Programmatic Integration: integrate with existing ad servers (for example Google Ad Manager, VAST or VPAID compatible SSPs) for dynamic ad delivery.
- Real Time Rotation: the system pulls ad creatives from a central repository or external DSP feed, automatically refreshing on defined intervals.

### Implementation Details
- Creative Feed API: endpoint `/api/ads/serve` returns JSON payload of current creatives by zone, including asset URL, duration, target event, and tracking pixels.
- Placement Logic: priority hierarchy of guaranteed sponsor over campaign target over filler ad; supports geo targeting, time of day rules, and event category matching.
- Ad Rendering: static image or video texture mapped onto 3D surfaces; animated banners or motion graphics rendered as lightweight shader layers; optional interactive hotspots linking to sponsor microsites.

### Admin Portal Controls
- Ad Library view showing all active creatives by sponsor and zone.
- Drag and drop assignment to stadium anchors with override priority.
- Real time preview and testing before deployment.
- Scheduling module for start and end dates, rotation weights, and targeting rules.

- Ad triggers: event start, timeout, halftime, replay, or player highlight.
- Creative expiration automatically reverts to default fallback.

### Reporting and Analytics
- Impressions, dwell time, and interaction metrics logged in real time.
- Sponsor performance dashboards include CTR, view duration, and zone heatmaps.
- Export reports to CSV or API feed for billing reconciliation.

### Technical Architecture
| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Ad Service | Hosts creative metadata and rotation logic |
| Content CDN | Delivers image or video assets globally with low latency |
| Integration API | Handles ad calls, targeting, and tracking responses |
| Renderer | Applies creative to 3D surface in Unity scene at runtime |

### Security and Compliance

- Programmatic refresh cycle runs automatically every 30 seconds without frame drop.
- Admins can replace any sponsor zone creative in under 2 minutes from upload to live render.
- Reporting latency under 5 minutes for impression metrics.

## 26. Ad System Revenue Share and Sponsor Reporting Integration
### Objective
Connect the programmatic ad engine directly to the franchise revenue share model, ensuring each venue and sponsor receives transparent performance data and accurate revenue allocation.

### Revenue Attribution Framework
1. Impression Based Allocation  
   Each ad view generates an impression log with timestamp, venue ID, sponsor ID, and creative ID. The central analytics engine aggregates impressions by venue, campaign, and time range. Revenue share is computed based on total impressions or CPM defined in the contract.
2. Sponsor Specific Attribution  
   Direct sponsorships (exclusive local deals) override programmatic fills in their assigned zones. System tags these impressions as guaranteed inventory for that sponsor. Reports separate guaranteed versus programmatic impressions for transparency.
3. Franchise Revenue Split (Default)  
   | Stream | Franchisor | Venue |  
   | --- | --- | --- |  
   | Programmatic Ads | 50 percent | 50 percent |  
   | Guaranteed Sponsorship Ads | 30 percent | 70 percent |  
   | National Brand Placements | 70 percent | 30 percent |  
   Percentages configurable per contract. Automated payout statements generated monthly.

### Reporting and Reconciliation
- Daily Analytics Feed: aggregates ad performance metrics (impressions, view time, CTR) per sponsor, venue, and creative.
- Revenue Engine: calculates earnings per impression or per campaign and allocates to each stakeholder.
- Dashboard Exports: venue and franchisor dashboards show total views and engagement metrics per zone, current CPM rate and accrued revenue, breakdown of local versus national campaigns, month to date and season to date payouts.

### Sponsor Reporting Portal
- Sponsors can log in to view campaign metrics (impressions, dwell time, engagement, conversion if applicable).
- Heatmap visualizations showing where viewers focused.
- Click through data for interactive ads.
- Option to download white label reports for marketing use.

### Compliance and Validation
- Automatic verification of logged impressions using timestamp and viewer session ID to prevent fraud.
- Duplicate or partial views filtered by the analytics service.
- Revenue records reconciled weekly with ad network reports (if external DSPs used).

### API Endpoints for Integration
```
GET  /ads/revenue?venue_id=&range=
GET  /ads/reports/sponsor?campaign_id=
POST /ads/reports/export
GET  /ads/heatmap?event_id=
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- Revenue data synchronized daily between ad server and franchise dashboard.
- Sponsor reporting latency < 6 hours after event end.
- Automatic monthly payout summaries generated with <1 percent variance to verified ad logs.
- Sponsors can access real time performance views without manual intervention.

## 27. Public API Integration Layer (Required vs. Optional)
### Purpose
Centralize and secure all third party integrations behind internal services so the platform remains private and franchise grade.

### Required Integrations
- Auth: Auth0 or AWS Cognito or Firebase Auth (federated logins, passkeys)
- Payments: Stripe (web plus mobile IAP sync)
- Storage or CDN: AWS S3 plus CloudFront or GCS plus Cloud CDN
- Telemetry: OpenTelemetry exporters to your metrics stack

### Optional Integrations
- Streaming: AWS IVS, Agora, Wowza (if not rolling pure WebRTC)
- Programmatic Ads: Google Ad Manager, SSP or DSP connectors
- Analytics: Mixpanel, Amplitude, GA4 for product analytics (aggregate)
- CRM and Marketing: Salesforce, HubSpot; email via SendGrid or Postmark

### Gateway Pattern
All third party API calls originate from integration services (server to server), using a secrets manager; no keys in clients. Retry and circuit breaker policies enabled.

## 28. Ad Sales Workflows (Venue and HQ)
### Roles
- Venue Seller: packages local sponsors
- HQ Ad Ops: reviews, traffics programmatic, QA
- Sponsor: uploads creative (optional portal)

### Workflows
1. Local Sponsorship  
   Seller selects inventory -> proposes rates -> contract signed -> invoice in Stripe -> creative uploaded -> placement scheduled -> live -> report.
2. Programmatic Fill  
   HQ defines zones eligible for programmatic -> connects GAM line items -> pacing and frequency caps -> realtime rotation.
3. Makegood or Replacement  
   If delivery shortfall, system auto reallocates impressions next event; seller notified.

### SLAs
- Creative QA < 24 hours; live swaps < 60 seconds; report T+6 hours.

## 29. Cloud Recording and Archival System (Internal Use)
### Goals
Private, durable storage for raw 360 captures and edited assets; searchable and shareable via signed links.

### Storage Tiers

`/property/season/event/camera/` with metadata records in DB.

### Upload Paths
- Manual: operator exports from camera -> admin upload
- Automated (Phase 2): watcher app auto uploads and tags; webhooks to transcoder

### Access Control
- RBAC plus signed URLs, watermark on review copies, audit logs on downloads.

## 30. Venue Readiness Checklist (Pre Event)
- Hardware: cameras mounted and leveled; batteries or power; spare media.
- Network: dedicated SSID; bandwidth >= 25 Mbps up per camera; latency < 100 ms; failover path tested.
- Auth: devices registered; time sync (NTP) OK.
- Client QA: account login; entitlement unlock; angles; zoom; sponsor zones render.
- Health Dashboard: all streams green; alerts configured.
- Runbook: escalation contacts; rollback creative prepared; promo codes loaded.

## 31. Beta Test Deployment Plan
### Scope
Two cameras (mid sideline, end zone), one event, 50 to 200 beta viewers.

### Success Metrics
- Time to first frame < 5 seconds
- Glass to glass < 1 second
- Rebuffer < 2 percent
- Crash free > 99.5 percent
- NPS >= 40

### Steps
1. Dry run in empty venue -> network soak test.
2. Staff rehearsal with zoom and ads.
3. Live beta -> collect telemetry and surveys.
4. Postmortem -> fix list -> go or no go for public launch.

## 32. Detailed Endpoint Schema (MVP)
**Auth**
- `POST /auth/signup {email, provider}` -> `{user_id}`
- `POST /auth/login {email|oauth}` -> `{access_token, refresh_token}`
- `POST /auth/magiclink {email}` -> `204`

**Catalog and Orders**
- `GET /catalog` -> `[{product_id, type: ticket|sub|addon, price, rules}]`
- `POST /orders {items:[{product_id, qty}], return_url}` -> `{checkout_url}`
- `POST /payments/webhook` (Stripe) -> `200`

**Entitlements**
- `GET /entitlements` -> `[{event_id, angles, expires_at}]`

**Events and Feeds**
- `GET /events?status=live|upcoming`
- `GET /events/{id}` -> `{venue, start, feeds}`
- `GET /events/{id}/feeds` -> `[{type:360, url, token, ttl_sec}]`

**Creative and Ads**
- `POST /creative/upload` (multipart) -> `{asset_id}`
- `POST /placements {event_id, anchor_id, asset_id, schedule}` -> `{placement_id}`
- `GET /ads/serve?event_id=&zone=` -> `{creative_url, duration, tracking}`

**Telemetry**
- `POST /metrics {session_id, metric, value, dims}` -> `204`

## 33. Data Contracts (Samples)
**Entitlement (JSON)**
```json
{
  "account_id": "u_123",
  "event_id": "evt_2025_10_18",
  "angles": ["sideline", "endzone", "broadcast"],
  "starts_at": "2025-10-18T18:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-10-20T18:00:00Z"
}
```

**Ad Serve Response**
```json
{
  "zone": "ribbon_1",
  "creative_url": "https://cdn.example.com/ads/acme_loop.mp4",
  "duration": 30,
  "priority": 90,
  "click_url": "https://acme.com/offer",
  "tracking": ["https://t.example.com/i?e=..."],
  "fallback": "https://cdn.example.com/ads/default.png"
}
```

## 34. QA and Test Plan
**Automated**
- API unit and contract tests
- Player performance tests (frame time, decode load)
- Synthetic ad rotation and revenue calc tests

**Manual**
- Venue end to end rehearsal
- Multi device login and entitlement checks
- Zoom artifact and motion comfort review

**Load**
- 5k concurrent session soak; chaos tests on feed failover

## 35. Risk Register (Top Items)
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rights ambiguity | High | Execute rights addendum per venue or conference |
| RF interference | Medium | Wired primary plus bonded 5G backup |
| Motion sickness | Medium | Comfort defaults, reduced FOV toggle |
| IAP or subscription sync drift | Medium | Single source of truth plus webhook reconciliation |
| Ad quality variance | Low | Creative QA plus auto transcoding profiles |

## 36. Timeline and Budget Snapshot (MVP)
- Phase 0 (2 weeks): rights plus vendor selection
- Phase 1 (6 to 8 weeks): core APIs, admin, basic player
- Phase 2 (6 weeks): purchase, entitlements, party, ads v1
- Phase 3 (4 weeks): scale tests, security hardening, beta launch

- CapEx: cameras and mounts ($5k to $15k per venue)
- OpEx: cloud or CDN $0.03 to $0.08 per GB egress; auth or payments fees per transaction

## 37. Go To Market and Launch Checklist
- Pilot venue contracted; franchise or license executed
- Equipment installed; certification passed
- Free trial game scheduled; promo assets approved
- Pricing page and upgrade CTA live (web or mobile or VR)
- Sponsor packages loaded; ad rotations tested
- Support runbook and escalation matrix distributed
- Post event report templates configured
