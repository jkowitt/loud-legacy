# Loud Legacy Documentation

This folder centralizes product, technical, and operational docs for the Loud Legacy portfolio. Key entry points:

- `tech-spec.md` – consolidated system and platform overview
- `ia-and-sitemaps.md` – information architecture for the hub and brand experiences
- `valora/` – detailed service runbooks, ADRs, and integration notes for VALORA
- `venuevr/` – VenueVR blueprint, architecture, and client playbooks

Future brands such as Business Now and DIY Mr Fix It can add subfolders using the same pattern.
